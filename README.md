event-base
==========

The ever-evolving base for Pilot event sites.

Use this as the repository to clone and modify for indvidual Pilot events. 

Dev notes
=========
Pull, npm install, run a dev server and you should be good to go. I use python -m SimpleHTTPServer in the out/ directory to serve the files locally.
